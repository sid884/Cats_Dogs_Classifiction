### README for Dogs and Cats Prediction Project

# 🐾 Dogs and Cats Prediction Project  

Welcome to the **Dogs and Cats Prediction Project** repository! This project demonstrates the application of **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence** techniques to create a predictive model that distinguishes between images of dogs and cats.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

This project involves building a robust machine learning model by:  
- Preprocessing and filtering data to ensure high-quality inputs.  
- Encoding categorical data for efficient processing.  
- Exploring serialization and clustering for optimal data representation.  
- Leveraging entropy-based methods for feature selection and information gain.  

The final model is trained to classify images of dogs and cats based on the extracted features, demonstrating practical AI applications.
