## 🚀 Project Overview  

This project involves building a robust machine learning model by:  
- Preprocessing and filtering data to ensure high-quality inputs.  
- Encoding categorical data for efficient processing.  
- Exploring serialization and clustering for optimal data representation.  
- Leveraging entropy-based methods for feature selection and information gain.  

The final model is trained to classify images of dogs and cats based on the extracted features, demonstrating practical AI applications.
